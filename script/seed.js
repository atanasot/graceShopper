            "Made up from Corton-Renardes (63%) and a mix of 24 other sectors on the Corton hill, this is a very fine Corton Grand Cru. Charlotte Dumay gave vineyards to the Hospices in 1534, and this is traditionally one of the Hospice's longest living cuvées. Lacks a little in concentration but makes up for this with freshness and elegance. Cool in the mouth, with a blueberry and dusky, dark, fruit character on both the nose and palate. Corton can often be rugged but this is smooth and refined. A very good 2014. Drinking window: 2022-2029. Score - 93. (Andy Howard, MW, decanter.com, Nov. 9, 2020)",

Worn-in leather, spices, licorice and tobacco meld into sweet dark cherries and plums in this full-bodied, intense Brunello. There is still more than enough fruit and sheer power to allow the 1999 to drink well for another 15-20 years, perhaps longer. The style is very much on the masculine, virile side of things. If opened today the 1999 needs time to come together in the glass.Drinking window: 2013-2029. Score - 93+. (Antonio Galloni, vinous.com, May 2012)",
